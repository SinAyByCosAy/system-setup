# 🧰 OmniSetup: System Bootstrapper

OmniSetup is a lightweight, cross-platform (macOS and Linux) utility designed to bootstrap fresh machines and automatically track your installed tools in version-controlled text files. 

## 🎯 Who is it for?
This tool is built for developers who want a reproducible environment without the overhead of heavy infrastructure tools like Ansible or Nix. It replaces manual installation steps with a streamlined, self-documenting workflow.

## 🚀 First-Time Setup
To set up a fresh machine, clone the repository and run the bootstrap script.
```console
git clone https://github.com/SinAyByCosAy/OmniSetup.git ~/OmniSetup
cd ~/OmniSetup
chmod +x bootstrap.sh
./bootstrap.sh
source ~/.zshrc
```
